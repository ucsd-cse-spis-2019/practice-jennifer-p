Hi there! I'm Jennifer Pham. I am from Fountain Valley, California. During SPIS I would like to learn how computers work and how to make a functional program. I enjoy drawing in my freetime, although I am not very good at it. I would be interested in participating in a Super Smash Brothers tournament, but that may be a bit difficult to set up here.
